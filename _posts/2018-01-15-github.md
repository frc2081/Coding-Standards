Keep commit messages concise

Stick to your own branch

Use Pull Requests to make changes to the master branch

Only commit directly to master if you know what you’re doing and after code review

Be careful when resolving merge conflicts

If you can’t explain why your change should be made, it probably shouldn’t be made
